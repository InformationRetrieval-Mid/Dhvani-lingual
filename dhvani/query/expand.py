"""Weighted query expansion: add phonetic variants to each query token.

Phase 1–2 gave us the pieces (k-gram candidates re-ranked by learned edit
distance); this is where they meet the query object. For each token we ask
``match.weighted_variants`` for the top-k spelling/phonetic variants and append
them to that token's ``expansions`` list as ``(term, weight, "phonetic")``. The
exact surface form stays as ``(surface, 1.0, "exact")``, so the ranker sees the
literal query *plus* its variants — e.g. ``mosam`` also pulls up ``मौसम``.

Cross-lingual (``"xling"``) expansions are Rishit's; we leave room for them and
never overwrite entries another source already added.

    only returns Devanagari homophones that pass the quality gate, so a true
