All four matchers are exposed so they can be compared head-to-head (that is the
Phase-5 results table). The **production** path is ``weighted_variants`` which
re-ranks by learned edit distance — the variants it returns are what Phase 3
drops into each query token's ``expansions`` list with source ``"phonetic"``.
