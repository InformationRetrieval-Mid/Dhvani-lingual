"""Per-word language identification for a mixed Hindi / Hinglish / English query.

A Dhvani query can mix three ways of writing the same thing: Devanagari Hindi
(``मौसम``), romanised Hindi a.k.a. Hinglish (``mausam``) and English
(``weather``). We label each *word* on its own, because one query often mixes
them: ``kal ka weather``.

The label is a weight over three readings ``{"hi", "hinglish", "en"}`` and these
feed the query object (format 4). The plan calls out that some words — "main",
"to", "hi" — are valid English words *and* common romanised Hindi, so instead of
forcing a choice we keep both readings with weights and let the ranker sort it
out downstream.

Scope: a lexicon-based identifier. The real coverage comes from a large bundled
English wordlist (``english_words.txt``); the small sets below handle the Hindi
side and the genuinely ambiguous words.
