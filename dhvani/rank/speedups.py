"""Faster cosine ranking by scoring fewer articles (Lecture 7).

Plain lnc.ltc scores every article that shares any word with the query. On
a real corpus that's most of the collection for common words. These methods
pick a smaller set of contenders A, score only those, and return the top k
from A. Cosine is only a proxy for what the user wants anyway, so a top k
that's close to the exact one is usually good enough.

Every search here returns (results, stats). stats says how many articles
were actually scored, so we can measure speed (articles scored) against
quality (how much of the exact top k we kept).

Index elimination
- Only high-idf query terms: words like का, की, में appear almost everywhere,
  add little to the score and drag in huge postings lists, so they're skipped.
- Only articles containing several query terms: with 3 or more query words
  an article has to contain most of them (a "soft AND"), e.g. 3 of 4.
