"""Plugs the real pieces into the ranker: Dhrithi's index and Viraja's query layer.

- ``load_index(mode)`` loads Dhrithi's index from ``indexes/<mode>.pkl`` and
  gives it an ``articles`` view of its stored text, so the app, CLI and kal see
  the same thing as with the sample index. If the index files haven't been
  built yet it falls back to the 20-article sample index.
- ``make_query(raw, mode)`` builds the query the way the articles were built:
  Viraja's ``build_query`` (exact words plus phonetic variants from the k-gram
  index over the unstemmed vocabulary), then the cross-lingual layer, then
  every expansion term goes through Dhrithi's analyzer for that index mode, so
  a stemmed index gets stemmed query terms.

Build the indexes first (article text stays local, in ``data/``):

    python -m index.build --input data/news_sample_300.jsonl

Set DHVANI_INDEX=sample to force the sample index (the tests do this so they
don't depend on whatever corpus is on the machine).
