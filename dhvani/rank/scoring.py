"""Net score: cosine plus zone, proximity and recency signals (Lecture 7).

    net(q, d) = cosine(q, d)
              + w_zone * zone_score(q, d)
              + w_prox * proximity(q, d)
              + w_recency * g(d)

- zone_score: weighted zone scoring. Each zone has a weight (headline counts
  more than body) and scores the fraction of query terms found in it.
- proximity: users prefer documents where the query words sit close together.
  We find the smallest window containing all matched query terms and score it
  as (number of terms) / (window length), so adjacent words give 1.0.
- g(d): query-independent static quality. For news that's recency,
  g(d) = exp(-age_in_days / tau), so a story from today gets 1.0.
