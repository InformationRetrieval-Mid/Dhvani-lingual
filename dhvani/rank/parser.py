"""Query parser: turn one free-text query into a cascade of stricter queries.

Lecture 7's example: for "rising interest rates", first run it as a phrase.
If fewer than K articles contain the phrase, run the shorter phrases
"rising interest" and "interest rates". If there still aren't K, fall back
to the plain vector space query. Matching articles are ranked by score.

Our cascade, from strictest to loosest:

    1. phrase            all words next to each other, in order, exact spellings
    2. sub-phrase        any two neighbouring words next to each other
    3. all words         every word somewhere in the article (Boolean AND)
    4. all words, with variants
                         every word, allowing phonetic or translated variants
    5. any word          free text: at least one word (plain vector space)

We stop as soon as the stages so far have found k articles. An article
found at a stricter stage always ranks above one found at a looser stage;
within a stage, the chosen ranker's score decides.

Phrase and sub-phrase checks use positions from the positional index
(Lecture 2). AND intersects postings starting from the rarest word
(Lecture 1 query optimisation).
